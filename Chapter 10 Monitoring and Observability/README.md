Chapter 10, Real-Time Monitoring and Observability, will look at how you can ensure that services in the Kubernetes cluster are always up and running. Will look at tools such as LimitRanger, which Kubernetes provides for resource management. We will also discuss open-source tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana, that can be used to monitor the state of a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, we will cover Observability in Kubernetes, which means using logs, metrics, and traces to understand system behavior.
