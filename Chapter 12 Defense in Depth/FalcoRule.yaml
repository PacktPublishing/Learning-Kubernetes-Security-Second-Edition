- rule: Read sensitive file untrusted
  desc: >
    An attempt to read any sensitive file (e.g. files containing user/password/authentication
    information). Exceptions are made for known trusted programs. Can be customized as needed.
    In modern containerized cloud infrastructures, accessing traditional Linux sensitive files
    might be less relevant, yet it remains valuable for baseline detections. While we provide additional
    rules for SSH or cloud vendor-specific credentials, you can significantly enhance your security
    program by crafting custom rules for critical application credentials unique to your environment.
