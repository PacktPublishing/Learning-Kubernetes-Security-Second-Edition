Will explore common attack techniques that exploit vulnerabilities within Kubernetes and containerized environments, focusing on how adversaries leverage Kubernetes misconfigurations, privilege escalation, and container escapes. With real-world examples readers will understand how attackers bypass security defenses and gain control over clusters. It guides readers through practical scenarios demonstrating container escape methods.
