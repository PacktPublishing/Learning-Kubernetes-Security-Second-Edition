Chapter 9, Shift Left (Scanning, SBOM and CI/CD), introduce the “Shift Left” approach in Kubernetes, emphasizing early detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities within the development lifecycle. Readers will explore techniques for scanning container images and code repositories for vulnerabilities, as well as generating and managing Software Bills of Materials (SBOM) to maintain a clear inventory of dependencies and components. Will explore some open-source tools like Grype, Syft, Trivy and some others. Will also cover Cosing to sign and validate images.
